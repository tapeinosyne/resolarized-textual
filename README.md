# Resolarized

*Resolarized* is a minimal Solarized theme for the Textual IRC client.

It features:
  - a smooth, unobtrusive Solarized palette
  - an adaptive light/dark color scheme based on Textual's appearance (and transitively, system appearance)
  - responsive layout and type, designed to work across common window sizes and widths (full screen, ½ screen, ⅓ screen)

Resolarized is currently LTR-only, with apologies.


## Installation

Clone this repository or copy its contents into the Textual user styles folder:

```bash
# for the Mac App Store version
git clone https://github.com/tapeinosyne/resolarized-textual "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/8482Q6EPL6.com.codeux.irc.textual/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles/"

# for the standalone version
git clone https://github.com/tapeinosyne/resolarized-textual "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/com.codeux.apps.textual/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles/"
…
```

You can also open a Finder window directly therein by launching `textual://custom-styles-folder` from a browser.


## Configuration

You might want to consider ticking `Disable nickname colors` in the `Style / Advanced` menu of the Textual preferences, as themes cannot trivially set custom colors and the defaults can be rather garish.
